# Riding the Wave: Exploring the WKB Approximation:
This repository contains Python code for the WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation, which is a method used in quantum mechanics to approximate wave functions in regions where they vary slowly. The WKB approximation is based on the assumption that the wave function can be written as a product of an amplitude and a phase factor, and that the phase factor varies much more rapidly than the amplitude. This leads to a differential equation for the amplitude, which can be solved approximately using standard techniques.

The code in this repository implements the WKB approximation for various potential energy functions, including the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom. It also includes a simple visualization tool that allows the user to explore the behavior of the wave function for different energy levels and potential shapes.

## Requirements
The code in this repository requires the following Python packages:
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

These packages can be installed using pip:
```
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
## Usage
The main code for the WKB approximation is contained in the file wkb.py. This file defines a class WKB, which implements the WKB approximation for a given potential energy function. The class has the following methods:

* __init__(self, V, x_range, E_range): Initializes the WKB object with a potential energy function V (a function that takes a position as input and returns the corresponding potential energy), a range of positions x_range to consider, and a range of energy levels E_range to explore.
* solve(self, n): Solves the WKB approximation for the energy level n.
* plot(self, n): Plots the WKB approximation for the energy level n.
* animate(self): Animates the WKB approximation for all energy levels.

To use the WKB class, simply create a new instance with the desired potential energy function, position range, and energy range:
```
import numpy as np
from wkb import WKB

# Define a potential energy function
def V(x):
    return x**2

# Create a new WKB object
wkb = WKB(V, x_range=(-10, 10), E_range=(0, 10))

# Solve for the energy level n=0
wkb.solve(n=0)

# Plot the WKB approximation
wkb.plot(n=0)
```
The repository also includes a simple visualization tool, which can be used to explore the behavior of the wave function for different potential energy functions. To use the visualization tool, simply run the file visualize.py:
```python visualize.py```
This will launch a GUI that allows the user to select a potential energy function and explore the behavior of the wave function for different energy levels.
